<p id="rcorners">As a Clinical Informatics intern with the Perinatal Research Center at UNC Chapel Hill, I conducted an in-depth survey of recent perinatal research to identify areas that have recently had the highest impact. I worked on visualization of the healthcare data sourced from CDS, WHO and NIH to uncover any trends or research gaps in recent work. I presented my visualizations and analysis via multiple talks on essential areas concerning pregnancy and postpartum.</p>

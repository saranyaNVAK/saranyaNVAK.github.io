<p id="rcorners">Objective: The present study deals with the fermentative production of l-arginase under solid state fermentation technique. Various nutritional as well as physical parameters were altered in order to maximize the yield.<br>

Method: L-Arginase has received significant attention in recent years owing to its potential applications in medicine as an anticancer agent, as an efficient diagnostic agent and as a biosensor. Production of the enzyme was carried out by using various solid substrates such as wheat bran, tea dust, rice bran, ragi, maize bran, black gram, bread, red gram as solid substrates. Various factors such as incubation periods (24-168 hrs), p H (5-10), inoculum size (2.5-15%), incubation temperature (20-450C), l-arginine concentration (0.5-3%), NaCl concentration (1-5%) etc. were altered and their effect on the production rate was noticed.<br>

Results: The maximum yield (66.08 IU/ml) of l-arginase by Idiomarina sediminium was obtained using tea dust as a solid substrate, initial pH 9.0, supplemented with maltose (1.0%), casein (1.0%), inoculated with 10% of inoculum and incubated at 37°C for 120 h.<br>

Conclusion: Solid state fermentation method can be adopted for large scale production of the enzyme for the therapeutic use in the future.</p>
